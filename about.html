    <p>Hello Everyone,
    I introduce myself as a hard working, energetic and an interesting personality. And I am those things, I’m also much more. I’m more than a limited character count and a filtered photo to be found in the void of social media. 
I love to travel, read books, despite of that, i love to do the animation stuff and playing with the materials in the adobe photoshop and illustrator. Back in my hometown i learned little bit idea on this sector which make my interest in it. Here i got much more knowledge on this. some of the software that i have knowledge of are:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

    <li> Adobe photoshop</li>

    <li>Adobe illustrator</li>

     <li>Adobe After effects</li>

    <li>Visual studio code</li>

    <li>Github</li>

    <li> html and css </li>

    <li> stop motion animation</li>

  </p>  
I’m a feminist. I’m an environmentalist. I’m from Nepal with a passion for seeing all parts of the world. You can find me listening music, try to dance in different forms and play games. If I had to choose a different lifetime I’d pick the 90s. 
I dream that the stories I get the privilege to bring to life never burn out. And, I’m still more than these things. I’m years of experiences. And I will be more things yet to come. 

Sandhya Stha
