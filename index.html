    <p style="font-size: 2vw;">Hi, welcome to my page. My name is Sandhya Shrestha. Premanantly I am from Nepal and current student of Bachelor of Interactive Media (BIM) in sydney, Australia. I came to Australia on march 2017. Australia is a unique and diverse country in every way - in culture, population, climate, geography, and history.
        Australian culture is as broad and varied as the country's landscape. Australia is multicultural and multiracial and this is reflected in the country's food, lifestyle and cultural practices and experience.
        Australia has an important heritage from its indigenous people, which plays a defining role in the cultural landscape. This diversity of influences creates a cultural environment in Australia that is lively, energised, innovative and outward looking. i hav e learnt many more from this country from being independent to learning new technologies in my course at wentworth institute.</p>
